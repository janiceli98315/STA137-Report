# STA137-Report
This report illustrates the time series analysis to forecast prices for conventional avocados, utilizing a dataset provided by \citep{abs}, including historical records spanning from 2015 to 2018. We first use  small trend method to decompose trend and seasonality analysis. After residual checking, we fit the residuals in AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA). Finally, we give the prediction of main trend by linear regression and seasonality by spectral analysis and rough component by ARIMA model. Through this comprehensive investigation, we aim to enhance price prediction accuracy, aiding farmers, distributors, and consumers in strategic decision-making.
